## Data Structure

Each gig is stored with the following comprehensive structure:

```json
{
  "url": "gig_url",
  "title": "gig_title",
  "editUrl": "edit_url",
  "scraped_at": "timestamp",
  "overview": {
    "title": "gig_title",
    "description": "full_description",
    "seller_info": {
      "name": "seller_name",
      "rating": "seller_rating",
      "level": "seller_level"
    },
    "packages": [...],
    "delivery_time": "delivery_info",
    "revisions": "revision_info",
    "tags": [...],
    "images": [...],
    "video": "video_url"
  },
  "pricing": {
    "packages": [...],
    "extras": [...],
    "currency": "currency_code"

  },
  "metadata": {
    "user_agent": "browser_info",
    "timestamp": "scrape_timestamp",
    "page_title": "page_title"
  }
}
```

## Database Schema

The Supabase database includes:

- **gigs table**: Main table storing all gig data
- **gig_summary view**: Simplified view for quick queries
- **upsert_gig_from_json()**: Function for inserting/updating gig data
- **get_gig_stats()**: Function for retrieving statistics
- **test_connection()**: Function for testing database connectivity

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Connection Issues**: Falls back to local storage if Supabase is unavailable
- **Scraping Errors**: Continues with other gigs if one fails
- **Tab Navigation**: Handles cases where tabs might not be found
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data integrity before storage

## Performance Considerations

- **Polite Scraping**: Includes delays between requests to avoid overwhelming servers
- **Background Tabs**: Opens gigs in background tabs to avoid disrupting user workflow
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress to keep users informed
- **Efficient Storage**: Uses JSONB for complex data structures in PostgreSQL

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Supabase Connection Failed**
   - Check your URL and API key
   - Ensure your Supabase project is active
   - Verify network connectivity

2. **Scraping Stops Midway**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure you're logged into Fiverr
   - Try refreshing and running again

3. **Missing Data**

   - Check the error field in stored data
   - The system will continue with available data
